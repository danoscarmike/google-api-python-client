<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None, pageSize=None, view=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves a summary of all quota information about this consumer that is
visible to the service producer, for each quota metric defined by the
service. Each metric includes information about all of its defined limits.
Each limit includes the limit configuration (quota unit, preciseness,
default value), the current effective limit value, and all of the overrides
applied to the limit.

Args:
  parent: string, Parent of the quotas resource.

An example parent would be:
`services/serviceconsumermanagement.googleapis.com/projects/123` (required)
  pageToken: string, Token identifying which result to start with; returned by a previous list
call.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
  pageSize: integer, Requested size of the next page of data.
  view: string, Specifies the level of detail for quota information in the response.

Returns:
