Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated
      # empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(advertiserId, orderBy=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None, filter=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists campaigns in an advertiser.

The order is defined by the order_by
parameter.
If a filter by
entity_status is not specified, campaigns with
`ENTITY_STATUS_ARCHIVED` will not be included in the results.

Args:
  advertiserId: string, The ID of the advertiser to list campaigns for. (required)
  orderBy: string, Field by which to sort the list.
Acceptable values are:

* `displayName` (default)
* `entityStatus`

The default sorting order is ascending. To specify descending order for
a field, a suffix "desc" should be added to the field name. Example:
`displayName desc`.
  pageSize: integer, Requested page size. Must be between `1` and `100`. If unspecified will
default to `100`.
  pageToken: string, A token identifying a page of results the server should return.
Typically, this is the value of
next_page_token returned from the
previous call to `ListCampaigns` method. If not specified, the first page
of results will be returned.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
  filter: string, Allows filtering by campaign properties.

Supported syntax:

* Filter expressions are made up of one or more restrictions.
* Restrictions can be combined by `AND` or `OR` logical operators. A
sequence of restrictions implicitly uses `AND`.
* A restriction has the form of `{field} {operator} {value}`.
* The operator must be `EQUALS (=)`.
* Supported fields:
    - `entityStatus`

Examples:

* All `ENTITY_STATUS_ACTIVE` or `ENTITY_STATUS_PAUSED` campaigns under an
advertiser:
`(entityStatus="ENTITY_STATUS_ACTIVE" OR
entityStatus="ENTITY_STATUS_PAUSED")`

The length of this field should be no more than 500 characters.
