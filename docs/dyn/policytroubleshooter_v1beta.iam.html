  <pre>Checks whether a member has a specific permission for a specific resource,
and explains why the member does or does not have that permission.

Args:
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request for TroubleshootIamPolicy.

        # resource.

          # `//compute.googleapis.com/projects/my-project/zones/us-central1-a/instances/my-instance`.

          # role, see https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/roles/reference.
      "principal": "A String", # Required. The member, or principal, whose access you want to check, in the form of
          # the email address that represents that member. For example,

          # `my-service-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.
          #
          # The member must be a Google Account or a service account. Other types of

    },
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
