  <pre>Analyzes IAM policies based on the specified request. Returns
a list of IamPolicyAnalysisResult matching the request.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The relative name of the root asset. Only resources and IAM policies within
the parent will be analyzed. This can only be an organization number (such
as "organizations/123") or a folder number (such as "folders/123"). (required)
  analysisQuery_identitySelector_identity: string, Required. The identity appear in the form of members in
[IAM policy
binding](https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/Binding).
  analysisQuery_accessSelector_roles: string, Optional. The roles to appear in result. (repeated)
  options_expandGroups: boolean, Optional. If true, the identities section of the result will expand any
Google groups appearing in an IAM policy binding.

If identity_selector is specified, the identity in the result will
be determined by the selector, and this flag will have no effect.

Default is false.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
  options_executionTimeout: string, Optional. Amount of time executable has to complete.  See JSON representation of
[Duration](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json).

If this field is set with a value less than the RPC deadline, and the
execution of your query hasn't finished in the specified
execution timeout,  you will get a response with partial result.
Otherwise, your query's execution will continue until the RPC deadline.
If it's not finished until then, you will get a  DEADLINE_EXCEEDED error.

Default is empty.
  options_expandResources: boolean, Optional. If true, the resource section of the result will expand any
resource attached to an IAM policy to include resources lower in the
resource hierarchy.

For example, if the request analyzes for which resources user A has
permission P, and the results include an IAM policy with P on a GCP
folder, the results will also include resources in that folder with
permission P.

If resource_selector is specified, the resource section of the result
will be determined by the selector, and this flag will have no effect.
Default is false.
  options_analyzeServiceAccountImpersonation: boolean, Optional. If true, the response will include access analysis from identities to
resources via service account impersonation. This is a very expensive
operation, because many derived queries will be executed. We highly
recommend you use ExportIamPolicyAnalysis rpc instead.

For example, if the request analyzes for which resources user A has
permission P, and there's an IAM policy states user A has
iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken permission to a service account SA,
and there's another IAM policy states service account SA has permission P
to a GCP folder F, then user A potentially has access to the GCP folder
F. And those advanced analysis results will be included in
AnalyzeIamPolicyResponse.service_account_impersonation_analysis.

Another example, if the request analyzes for who has
permission P to a GCP folder F, and there's an IAM policy states user A
has iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission to a service account SA, and
there's another IAM policy states service account SA has permission P to
the GCP folder F, then user A potentially has access to the GCP folder
F. And those advanced analysis results will be included in
AnalyzeIamPolicyResponse.service_account_impersonation_analysis.

Default is false.
  options_expandRoles: boolean, Optional. If true, the access section of result will expand any roles
appearing in IAM policy bindings to include their permissions.

If access_selector is specified, the access section of the result
will be determined by the selector, and this flag will have no effect.

Default is false.
  options_outputResourceEdges: boolean, Optional. If true, the result will output resource edges, starting
from the policy attached resource, to any expanded resources.
Default is false.
  analysisQuery_accessSelector_permissions: string, Optional. The permissions to appear in result. (repeated)
  analysisQuery_resourceSelector_fullResourceName: string, Required. The [full resource
name](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#full_resource_name)
.
  options_outputGroupEdges: boolean, Optional. If true, the result will output group identity edges, starting
from the binding's group members, to any expanded identities.
Default is false.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    <code class="details" id="exportIamPolicyAnalysis">exportIamPolicyAnalysis(parent, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Exports IAM policy analysis based on the specified request. This API
implements the google.longrunning.Operation API allowing you to keep
track of the export. The metadata contains the request to help callers to
map responses to requests.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The relative name of the root asset. Only resources and IAM policies within
the parent will be analyzed. This can only be an organization number (such
as "organizations/123") or a folder number (such as "folders/123"). (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A request message for AssetService.ExportIamPolicyAnalysis.
    "outputConfig": { # Output configuration for export IAM policy analysis destination. # Required. Output configuration indicating where the results will be output to.
      "gcsDestination": { # A Cloud Storage location. # Destination on Cloud Storage.
        "uri": "A String", # Required. The uri of the Cloud Storage object. It's the same uri that is used by
            # gsutil. For example: "gs://bucket_name/object_name". See [Viewing and
            # Editing Object
            # Metadata](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/viewing-editing-metadata)
            # for more information.
      },
    },
    "options": { # Contains request options. # Optional. The request options.
      "expandResources": True or False, # Optional. If true, the resource section of the result will expand any
          # resource attached to an IAM policy to include resources lower in the
          # resource hierarchy.
          #
          # For example, if the request analyzes for which resources user A has
          # permission P, and the results include an IAM policy with P on a GCP
          # folder, the results will also include resources in that folder with
          # permission P.
          #
          # If resource_selector is specified, the resource section of the result
          # will be determined by the selector, and this flag will have no effect.
          # Default is false.
      "expandRoles": True or False, # Optional. If true, the access section of result will expand any roles
          # appearing in IAM policy bindings to include their permissions.
          #
          # If access_selector is specified, the access section of the result
          # will be determined by the selector, and this flag will have no effect.
          #
          # Default is false.
      "outputGroupEdges": True or False, # Optional. If true, the result will output group identity edges, starting
          # from the binding's group members, to any expanded identities.
          # Default is false.
      "outputResourceEdges": True or False, # Optional. If true, the result will output resource edges, starting
          # from the policy attached resource, to any expanded resources.
          # Default is false.
      "expandGroups": True or False, # Optional. If true, the identities section of the result will expand any
          # Google groups appearing in an IAM policy binding.
          #
          # If identity_selector is specified, the identity in the result will
          # be determined by the selector, and this flag will have no effect.
          #
          # Default is false.
      "analyzeServiceAccountImpersonation": True or False, # Optional. If true, the response will include access analysis from identities to
          # resources via service account impersonation. This is a very expensive
          # operation, because many derived queries will be executed.
          #
          # For example, if the request analyzes for which resources user A has
          # permission P, and there's an IAM policy states user A has
          # iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken permission to a service account SA,
          # and there's another IAM policy states service account SA has permission P
          # to a GCP folder F, then user A potentially has access to the GCP folder
          # F. And those advanced analysis results will be included in
          # AnalyzeIamPolicyResponse.service_account_impersonation_analysis.
          #
          # Another example, if the request analyzes for who has
          # permission P to a GCP folder F, and there's an IAM policy states user A
          # has iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission to a service account SA, and
          # there's another IAM policy states service account SA has permission P to
          # the GCP folder F, then user A potentially has access to the GCP folder
          # F. And those advanced analysis results will be included in
          # AnalyzeIamPolicyResponse.service_account_impersonation_analysis.
