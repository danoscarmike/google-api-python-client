<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="lookupEffectiveGuestPolicy">lookupEffectiveGuestPolicy(instance, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lookup the effective guest policy that applies to a VM instance. This
lookup merges all policies that are assigned to the instance ancestry.

Args:
  instance: string, Required. The VM instance whose policies are being looked up. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A request message for getting the effective guest policy assigned to the
      # instance.
    "osArchitecture": "A String", # Architecture of OS running on the instance. The OS Config agent only
        # provides this field for targeting if OS Inventory is enabled for that
        # instance.
    "osVersion": "A String", # Version of the OS running on the instance. The OS Config agent only
        # provides this field for targeting if OS Inventory is enabled for that
        # VM instance.
    "osShortName": "A String", # Short name of the OS running on the instance. The OS Config agent only
        # provides this field for targeting if OS Inventory is enabled for that
        # instance.
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:
