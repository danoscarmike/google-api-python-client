Args:

  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Service acts as a top-level container that manages a set of Routes and
      # Configurations which implement a network service. Service exists to provide a
      # singular abstraction which can be access controlled, reasoned about, and

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(name, kind=None, propagationPolicy=None, apiVersion=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Delete a service.
This will cause the Service to stop serving traffic and will delete the
child entities like Routes, Configurations and Revisions.

Args:
  name: string, The name of the service to delete.
For Cloud Run (fully managed), replace {namespace_id} with the project ID
or number. (required)
  kind: string, Cloud Run currently ignores this parameter.
  propagationPolicy: string, Specifies the propagation policy of delete. Cloud Run currently ignores
this setting, and deletes in the background. Please see
kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/garbage-collection/ for
more information.
  apiVersion: string, Cloud Run currently ignores this parameter.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

  <pre>Get the IAM Access Control policy currently in effect for the given
Cloud Run service. This result does not include any inherited policies.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being requested.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  options_requestedPolicyVersion: integer, Optional. The policy format version to be returned.

Valid values are 0, 1, and 3. Requests specifying an invalid value will be
rejected.

Requests for policies with any conditional bindings must specify version 3.
Policies without any conditional bindings may specify any valid value or
leave the field unset.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:

      # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
      # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
      # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
      # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
      # custom role.
      #
      # Optionally, a `binding` can specify a `condition`, which is a logical
      # expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates
      # to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the
      # request, the resource, or both.

        # It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the

        # ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.

        # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field
        # whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows

        #
        # * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding
        # * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy
        # * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy

        # you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
        # the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
