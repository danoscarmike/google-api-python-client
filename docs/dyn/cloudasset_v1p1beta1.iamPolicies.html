<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="searchAll">searchAll(scope, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, query=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Searches all the IAM policies under a given accessible CRM scope
(project/folder/organization). This RPC gives callers
especially admins the ability to search all the IAM policies under a scope,
even if they don't have .getIamPolicy permission of all the IAM policies.
Callers should have cloud.assets.SearchAllIamPolicies permission on the
requested scope, otherwise it will be rejected.

Args:
  scope: string, Required. The relative name of an asset. The search is limited to the resources
within the `scope`. The allowed value must be:
* Organization number (such as "organizations/123")
* Folder number(such as "folders/1234")
* Project number (such as "projects/12345")
* Project id (such as "projects/abc") (required)
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The page size for search result pagination. Page size is capped at 500 even
if a larger value is given. If set to zero, server will pick an appropriate
default. Returned results may be fewer than requested. When this happens,
there could be more results as long as `next_page_token` is returned.
  pageToken: string, Optional. If present, retrieve the next batch of results from the preceding call to
this method. `page_token` must be the value of `next_page_token` from the
previous response. The values of all other method parameters must be
identical to those in the previous call.
  query: string, Optional. The query statement.
Examples:
* "policy:myuser@mydomain.com"
* "policy:(myuser@mydomain.com viewer)"
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Search all IAM policies response.
    "nextPageToken": "A String", # Set if there are more results than those appearing in this response; to get
        # the next set of results, call this method again, using this value as the
        # `page_token`.

            # `projects/{project_number}`. If an IAM policy is set on a resource (like VM
            # instance, Cloud Storage bucket), the project field will indicate the
            # project that contains the resource. If an IAM policy is set on a folder or
            # orgnization, the project field will be empty.
        "policy": { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access # The IAM policy directly set on the given resource. Note that the original

            # policies (e.g. an empty query), this contains all the bindings.

            #
            #
            # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
            # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
            # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
            # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
            # custom role.
            #
            # Optionally, a `binding` can specify a `condition`, which is a logical
            # expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates
            # to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the
            # request, the resource, or both.
