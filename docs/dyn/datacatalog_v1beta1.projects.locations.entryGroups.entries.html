  <pre>Creates an entry. Only entries of 'FILESET' type or user-specified type can
be created.

Users should enable the Data Catalog API in the project identified by
the `parent` parameter (see [Data Catalog Resource Project]
(https://cloud.google.com/data-catalog/docs/concepts/resource-project) for
more information).

A maximum of 100,000 entries may be created per entry group.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The name of the entry group this entry is in. Example:

* projects/{project_id}/locations/{location}/entryGroups/{entry_group_id}

Note that this Entry and its child resources may not actually be stored in
the location in this name. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

<div class="method">

  <pre>Gets the access control policy for a resource. A `NOT_FOUND` error
is returned if the resource does not exist. An empty policy is returned
if the resource exists but does not have a policy set on it.

Supported resources are:
  - Tag templates.
  - Entries.
  - Entry groups.
Note, this method cannot be used to manage policies for BigQuery, Pub/Sub
and any external Google Cloud Platform resources synced to Data Catalog.

Callers must have following Google IAM permission
  - `datacatalog.tagTemplates.getIamPolicy` to get policies on tag
    templates.
  - `datacatalog.entries.getIamPolicy` to get policies on entries.
  - `datacatalog.entryGroups.getIamPolicy` to get policies on entry groups.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being requested.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

          #
          # Valid values are 0, 1, and 3. Requests specifying an invalid value will be
          # rejected.
          #
          # Requests for policies with any conditional bindings must specify version 3.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns the caller's permissions on a resource.
If the resource does not exist, an empty set of permissions is returned
(We don't return a `NOT_FOUND` error).

Supported resources are:
  - Tag templates.
  - Entries.
  - Entry groups.
Note, this method cannot be used to manage policies for BigQuery, Pub/Sub
and any external Google Cloud Platform resources synced to Data Catalog.

A caller is not required to have Google IAM permission to make this
request.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    "permissions": [ # The set of permissions to check for the `resource`. Permissions with
        # wildcards (such as '*' or 'storage.*') are not allowed. For more

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:
