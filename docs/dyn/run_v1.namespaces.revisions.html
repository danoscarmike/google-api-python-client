  <pre>List revisions.

Args:
  parent: string, The namespace from which the revisions should be listed.
For Cloud Run (fully managed), replace {namespace_id} with the project ID
or number. (required)
  labelSelector: string, Allows to filter resources based on a label. Supported operations are
=, !=, exists, in, and notIn.
  includeUninitialized: boolean, Not currently used by Cloud Run.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
  resourceVersion: string, The baseline resource version from which the list or watch operation should
start. Not currently used by Cloud Run.
  limit: integer, The maximum number of records that should be returned.
  watch: boolean, Flag that indicates that the client expects to watch this resource as well.
Not currently used by Cloud Run.
  continue: string, Optional encoded string to continue paging.
  fieldSelector: string, Allows to filter resources based on a specific value for a field name.
Send this in a query string format. i.e. 'metadata.name%3Dlorem'.
Not currently used by Cloud Run.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

              # DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be
              # deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is
              # requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The
              # resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists,
              # and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the
              # finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items,
              # deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not
              # be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or
              # the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may
              # request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by
              # sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After
              # that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL)
              # to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the
              # presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this
              # timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the
              # resource is fully terminated.
