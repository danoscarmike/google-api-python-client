Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of the namespace this service will belong to. (required)
  body: object, The request body.

    # A service must exist before
    # endpoints can be
    # added to it.
  "endpoints": [ # Output only. Endpoints associated with this service. Returned on LookupService.Resolve.
      # Control plane clients should use RegistrationService.ListEndpoints.
    { # An individual endpoint that provides a
        # service. The service must
        # already exist to create an endpoint.
      "address": "A String", # Optional. An IPv4 or IPv6 address. Service Directory will reject bad
          # addresses like:

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access

      # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
      # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
      # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
      # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
      # custom role.
      #
      # Optionally, a `binding` can specify a `condition`, which is a logical
      # expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates
      # to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the
      # request, the resource, or both.

        # ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.
        #
        # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field
        # whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, orderBy=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None, filter=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists all services belonging to a namespace.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of the namespace whose services we'd
like to list. (required)
  orderBy: string, Optional. The order to list result by.
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The maximum number of items to return.
  pageToken: string, Optional. The next_page_token value returned from a previous List request,
if any.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
  filter: string, Optional. The filter to list result by.

General filter string syntax:
&lt;field&gt; &lt;operator&gt; &lt;value&gt; (&lt;logical connector&gt;)
&lt;field&gt; can be "name", or "metadata.&lt;key&gt;" for map field.
&lt;operator&gt; can be "&lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, !=, =, :". Of which ":" means HAS, and
is roughly the same as "=".
&lt;value&gt; must be the same data type as field.
&lt;logical connector&gt; can be "AND, OR, NOT".

Examples of valid filters:
* "metadata.owner" returns Services that have a label with the key "owner"
  this is the same as "metadata:owner".
* "metadata.protocol=gRPC" returns Services that have key/value
  "protocol=gRPC".
* "name&gt;projects/my-project/locations/us-east/namespaces/my-namespace/services/service-c"
  returns Services that have name that is alphabetically later than the
  string, so "service-e" will be returned but "service-a" will not be.
* "metadata.owner!=sd AND metadata.foo=bar" returns Services that have
  "owner" in label key but value is not "sd" AND have key/value foo=bar.
* "doesnotexist.foo=bar" returns an empty list. Note that Service doesn't
  have a field called "doesnotexist". Since the filter does not match any
  Services, it returns no results.
