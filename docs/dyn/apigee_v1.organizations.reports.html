  <pre>Creates a Custom Report for an Organization. A Custom Report
provides Apigee Customers to create custom dashboards in addition
to the standard dashboards which are provided. The Custom Report in its
simplest form contains specifications about metrics, dimensions and
filters. It is important to note that the custom report by itself does not
provide an executable entity. The Edge UI converts the custom report
definition into an analytics query and displays the result in a chart.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent organization name under which the Custom Report will
be created. Must be of the form:
  `organizations/{organization_id}/reports` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:
