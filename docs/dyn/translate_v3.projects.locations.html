  <pre>Translates a large volume of text in asynchronous batch mode.
This function provides real-time output as the inputs are being processed.
If caller cancels a request, the partial results (for an input file, it's
all or nothing) may still be available on the specified output location.

This call returns immediately and you can
use google.longrunning.Operation.name to poll the status of the call.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Location to make a call. Must refer to a caller's project.

Format: `projects/{project-number-or-id}/locations/{location-id}`.

The `global` location is not supported for batch translation.

Only AutoML Translation models or glossaries within the same region (have
the same location-id) can be used, otherwise an INVALID_ARGUMENT (400)
error is returned. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The batch translation request.
    "sourceLanguageCode": "A String", # Required. Source language code.

          # and defines options for applying that glossary.
        "glossary": "A String", # Required. The `glossary` to be applied for this translation.
            #
            # The format depends on glossary:

            # - User provided custom glossary:

        # The value format depends on model type:

      "gcsDestination": { # The Google Cloud Storage location for the output content. # Google Cloud Storage destination for output content.
          # For every single input file (for example, gs://a/b/c.[extension]), we

          # Output files (tsv) generated are compliant with RFC 4180 except that
          # record delimiters are '\n' instead of '\r\n'. We don't provide any way to
          # change record delimiters.
          #

          # 'index.csv'  under 'output_uri_prefix' (for example,
          # gs://translation-test/index.csv) The index file is generated/updated as

          #
          # Once a row is present in index.csv, the input/output matching never

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list_next">list_next(previous_request, previous_response)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

Args:
  previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
  previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

Returns:
  A request object that you can call 'execute()' on to request the next

</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="translateText">translateText(parent, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Translates input text and returns translated text.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Project or location to make a call. Must refer to a caller's
project.

Format: `projects/{project-number-or-id}` or
`projects/{project-number-or-id}/locations/{location-id}`.

For global calls, use `projects/{project-number-or-id}/locations/global` or
`projects/{project-number-or-id}`.

Non-global location is required for requests using AutoML models or
custom glossaries.

Models and glossaries must be within the same region (have same
location-id), otherwise an INVALID_ARGUMENT (400) error is returned. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request message for synchronous translation.

    "sourceLanguageCode": "A String", # Optional. The BCP-47 language code of the input text if
        # known, for example, "en-US" or "sr-Latn". Supported language codes are
        # listed in Language Support. If the source language isn't specified, the API
        # attempts to identify the source language automatically and returns the
        # source language within the response.

        # text, set to one of the language codes listed in Language Support.
    "labels": { # Optional. The labels with user-defined metadata for the request.

        # `projects/{project-number-or-id}/locations/global/models/general/nmt`.
