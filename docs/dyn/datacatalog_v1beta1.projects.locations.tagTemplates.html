Note, this method cannot be used to manage policies for BigQuery, Pub/Sub
and any external Google Cloud Platform resources synced to Data Catalog.

Callers must have following Google IAM permission
  - `datacatalog.tagTemplates.getIamPolicy` to get policies on tag
    templates.
  - `datacatalog.entries.getIamPolicy` to get policies on entries.
  - `datacatalog.entryGroups.getIamPolicy` to get policies on entry groups.

Args:

Users should enable the Data Catalog API in the project identified by
the `tag_template.name` parameter (see [Data Catalog Resource Project]
(https://cloud.google.com/data-catalog/docs/concepts/resource-project) for
more information).

Args:

    <code class="details" id="setIamPolicy">setIamPolicy(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Sets the access control policy for a resource. Replaces any existing
policy.
Supported resources are:
  - Tag templates.
  - Entries.
  - Entry groups.
Note, this method cannot be used to manage policies for BigQuery, Pub/Sub

Callers must have following Google IAM permission

    templates.
  - `datacatalog.entries.setIamPolicy` to set policies on entries.
  - `datacatalog.entryGroups.setIamPolicy` to set policies on entry groups.

    The object takes the form of:

  <pre>Returns the caller's permissions on a resource.
If the resource does not exist, an empty set of permissions is returned
(We don't return a `NOT_FOUND` error).

Supported resources are:
  - Tag templates.
  - Entries.
  - Entry groups.
Note, this method cannot be used to manage policies for BigQuery, Pub/Sub
and any external Google Cloud Platform resources synced to Data Catalog.

A caller is not required to have Google IAM permission to make this
request.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    "permissions": [ # The set of permissions to check for the `resource`. Permissions with
        # wildcards (such as '*' or 'storage.*') are not allowed. For more

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:
