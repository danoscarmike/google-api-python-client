<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="split">split(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Splits capacity commitment to two commitments of the same plan and
commitment_end_time. A common use case to do that is to perform a downgrade
e.g., in order to downgrade from 10000 slots to 8000, one might split 10000
capacity commitment to 2000 and 8000, change the plan of the first one to
flex and then delete it.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The resource name e.g.,:
  projects/myproject/locations/US/capacityCommitments/123 (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request for ReservationService.SplitCapacityCommitment.
    "slotCount": "A String", # Number of slots in the capacity commitment after the split.
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # The response for ReservationService.SplitCapacityCommitment.
    "second": { # Capacity commitment is a way to purchase compute capacity for BigQuery jobs # Second capacity commitment, result of a split.
        # (in the form of slots) with some committed period of usage. Annual
        # commitments renew by default. Commitments can be removed after their
        # commitment end time passes. In order to remove annual commitment, its plan
        # needs to be changed to monthly or flex first.
