<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(parent, body=None, name=None, x__xgafv=None, action=None)</code>
  <pre>Uploads a ZIP-formatted shared flow configuration bundle to an
organization. If the shared flow already exists, this creates a new
revision of it. If the shared flow does not exist, this creates it.

Once imported, the shared flow revision must be deployed before it can be
accessed at runtime.

The size limit of a shared flow bundle is 15 MB.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The name of the parent organization under which to create the
shared flow. Must be of the form:
  `organizations/{organization_id}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Message that represents an arbitrary HTTP body. It should only be used for
      # payload formats that can't be represented as JSON, such as raw binary or
      # an HTML page.
      # 
      # 
      # This message can be used both in streaming and non-streaming API methods in
      # the request as well as the response.
      # 
      # It can be used as a top-level request field, which is convenient if one
      # wants to extract parameters from either the URL or HTTP template into the
      # request fields and also want access to the raw HTTP body.
      # 
      # Example:
      # 
      #     message GetResourceRequest {
      #       // A unique request id.
      #       string request_id = 1;
      # 
      #       // The raw HTTP body is bound to this field.
      #       google.api.HttpBody http_body = 2;
      #     }
      # 
      #     service ResourceService {
      #       rpc GetResource(GetResourceRequest) returns (google.api.HttpBody);
      #       rpc UpdateResource(google.api.HttpBody) returns
      #       (google.protobuf.Empty);
      #     }
      # 
      # Example with streaming methods:
      # 
      #     service CaldavService {
      #       rpc GetCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody)
      #         returns (stream google.api.HttpBody);
      #       rpc UpdateCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody)
      #         returns (stream google.api.HttpBody);
      #     }
      # 
      # Use of this type only changes how the request and response bodies are
      # handled, all other features will continue to work unchanged.
    "extensions": [ # Application specific response metadata. Must be set in the first response
        # for streaming APIs.
      {
        "a_key": "", # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],

    "data": "A String", # The HTTP request/response body as raw binary.
  }
